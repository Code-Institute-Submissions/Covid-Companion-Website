This is a website for a volunteer organisation called "Covid Companion". Covid Companion was set up to provide help for both old people and people who are classed as vulnerable during the current Covid-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic.
Their goal is to connect the old and vulnerable with people who are willing to volunteer their time to retrieve essential goods such as food and medication. This goal is achieved by providing a
navigable website that is very simplistic and that ensures all user actions that result in an error are given sufficient feedback in order to correct the mistake. This is a vital part of the website
in order to make the users experience as enjoyable and easy as possible while also ensuring the website is friendly to all types of users, specifically elderly people who may not be as "tech-savy".

Once registered, volunteer users will be given access to the "Give Help" page where they can see all the posts that have been created by people reaching out looking for help. They will be able to filter by county to find
people in their county that are in need of help and then open their post to see what the person is in need of. All posts have a status field which can be updated by volunteers. By default, posts will be assigned the "Available" status
once created, inside of the posts users can change the status to "In Progress" when they take on the role of retrieving the post creators things & "Complete" once they have delivered the items to the person in need.

Once registered, vulnerable users can navigable to the "Get Help" page where users can create posts. When creating a post, half of the form is automatically filled in for you, the information is 
retrieved from the users profile however these values can be changed like any other input field in case that the user is filling out a form on behalf of a family member or friend who does not have 
access to a computer. Users also have the option to provide the volunteer with a list of items that they require or can click the "Is this a Click and Collect Order ?" checkbox and provide the order 
number that they were given from the shop when they completed their click and collect order on their website.

## User Experience (UX)

- ### User stories
    - #### First time user 
        1. As a first time user, I want to be greeted with an appealing website that makes finding important information about the organisation a seamless task.
        2. As a first time user, I want to be greeted with an easily navigable website which would require a simple and clean navigation bar.
        3. As a first time user, I want to be given feedback on any mistakes/actions I make such as an error message.
        4. As a first time user, I want to be able to create an account so that I can explore the options I have as a registered user. 
    - #### Vulnerable person 
        1. As a Vulnerable person, I want to be able to create a post to describe in detail what I am in need of.
        2. As a Vulnerable person, I want to be able to see the post I created to make sure it posted and to ensure that all the information is correct.
        3. As a Vulnerable person, I want to be able to edit a post that I created but accidentally made some typos on.
        4. As a Vulnerable person, I want to be able to delete a post after a volunteer has kindly done my shopping for me.
    - #### Volunteer 
        1. As a Volunteer, I want to be able to view posts that vulnerable people have created so that I can do my part by helping the people in need in my community.
        2. As a Volunteer, I want to be able to get in contact with the creator of the post to double check they don't need anything else while I'm out.
        3. As a Volunteer, I want to be able to communicate to the post creator and other volunteers that I am going to do the shop to ensure more than 1 person isn't getting things for the one person at the same time.
    - #### Returning user

        2. As a Returning user, I want to be able to logout of my account for privacy and safety reasons.

- ### Design
    - #### Colour Scheme
        - The 2 main colours I chose for the project was #3c3c3c (a dark gray) & #feb62e (A mustard yellow/light orange) while also incorporating #f5f5f5 (an off-white) too as I felt
        that the constant use of a dark colour (#3c3c3c) on a vibrant mustard yellow (#feb62e) would be too much and instead the mustard yellow would be used to make certain features 
        "pop"/stick out and make them more visually powerful.
        - Originally I planned to go with black (#000) and a very bright yellow that is usually seen on Covid-19 warning signs such as [here](https://www.rehab.ie/images_upload/news-and-stories/blogs/COVID.jpg)
        however after considering the thoughts the user could generate after seeing such bright colours I reconsidered the colour scheme as the website is meant to be warm and welcoming. Many people 
        would consider bright yellow as a colour of warning and can is usually used to grab the attention of a person, as a result I changed the colour scheme to a mustard yellow / bright orange
        (#feb62e) and also changed the black to a dark grey (#3c3c3c) to ensure the website felt warm and welcoming to the user so they are instantly attracted to the site and
        there mind is relaxed and feels secure to ensure the best user experience. The Psychological effects that colours can have was a big part of deciding what colours to go with.
            - [#3c3c3c](https://www.color-hex.com/color/3c3c3c) (Dark gray): "Black communicates absolute clarity, with no fine nuances. It communicates sophistication and uncompromising 
            excellence and it works particularly well with white. Black creates a perception of weight and seriousness."
            - [#feb62e](https://www.color-hex.com/color/feb62e) (Mustard Yellow/Light Orange): "Since it is a combination of red and yellow, orange is stimulating and the reaction to 
            it is a combination of the physical and the  emotional. It focuses our minds on issues of physical comfort - food, warmth, shelter etc. - and sensuality. It is a 'fun' colour."

###### Last Updated: 14:02pm GMT - 18/04/20 

### Features Left to Implement
##### These are features that have not been added at the time of development due to various reasons such as time limitations.

## Database Schema
- The Database is made up of 3 collections in total, `counties`, `posts` & `users`
#### Counties Collection
- The counties collection has 32 documents overall, each one containing 2 keys, the autogenerated _id & county_name which contains the name of a county of Ireland.
- The decision to create the collection was to make it easy to store the county names and then loop thorugh them in a drop down while creating a posts. I originally planned
to also be able to filter by county on the Give Help page which would contain another drop down that looped through this collection however due to time limitations that function
was not complete.
```
    '_id': ObjectId('...'),
    'county_name': '...',
```
#### Posts Collection
- The posts collection houses all the posts that are created in the Get Help Page.
- There are 11 keys overall inc: the autogenerated _id key. When a post is created, it automatically is assigned the status of "Available"
and the post_creator retrieves the logged in users (session['user_id']) _id and is stored as a string. The values for the rest of the keys are
retrieved from the form that the user fills out when creating a post.
```
    '_id': ObjectId('...'),
    'title': '...',
    'description': '...',
    'order_number': '...',
    'county': '...',
    'address': '...',
    'name': '...',
    'email': '...',
    'phone_number': '...',
    'status': '...',
    'post_creator': '...'
```
#### Users Collection
- The users collection houses all the user profiles that are created when signing up and registering an account.
- There are 9 keys overall inc: the autogenerated _id key. The values for all of the keys are retrieved from the 
form that the user fills out when signing up and registering an account. When signing up, the user has to 
type the password twice however before any data is inserted in to the collection the passwords are checked to confirm
they are the same, the password is then hashed and inserted once.
```
    '_id': ObjectId('...'),
    'first_name': '...',
    'last_name': '...',
    'user_email': '...',
    'password': '...',
    'user_phone': '...',
    'user_address': '...',
    'user_type': '...',
    'is_over_18': '...'
```
