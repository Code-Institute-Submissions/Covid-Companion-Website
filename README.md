This is a website for a volunteer organisation called "Covid Companion". Covid Companion was set up to provide help for both old people and people who are classed as vulnerable during the current Covid-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic.
Their goal is to connect the old and vulnerable with people who are willing to volunteer their time to retrieve essential goods such as food and medication. This goal is achieved by providing a
navigable website that is very simplistic and that ensures all user actions that result in an error are given sufficient feedback in order to correct the mistake. This is a vital part of the website
in order to make the users experience as enjoyable and easy as possible while also ensuring the website is friendly to all types of users, specifically elderly people who may not be as "tech-savy".

Once registered, volunteer users will be given access to the "Give Help" page where they can see all the posts that have been created by people reaching out looking for help. They will be able to filter by county to find
people in their county that are in need of help and then open their post to see what the person is in need of. All posts have a status field which can be updated by volunteers. By default, posts will be assigned the "Available" status
once created, inside of the posts users can change the status to "In Progress" when they take on the role of retrieving the post creators things & "Complete" once they have delivered the items to the person in need.

Once registered, vulnerable users can navigable to the "Get Help" page where users can create posts. When creating a post, half of the form is automatically filled in for you, the information is 
retrieved from the users profile however these values can be changed like any other input field in case that the user is filling out a form on behalf of a family member or friend who does not have 
access to a computer. Users also have the option to provide the volunteer with a list of items that they require or can click the "Is this a Click and Collect Order ?" checkbox and provide the order 
number that they were given from the shop when they completed their click and collect order on their website.
